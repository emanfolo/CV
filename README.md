## Emmanuel Folorunsho

I am a driven by self-improvement, passionate about learning, and motivated to actualise my full potential. In my professional career since graduating I have gained valuable business and finance knowledge as well as a determination to achieve my goals. What excites me the most about tech is the ever expanding pool of knowledge to draw from, I believe this field is a perfect match for my intellectual curiosity.

I am a highly motivated self-starter with a keen interest in web development. I enjoy solving problems and am capable of providing solutions both collaboratively as well as independently.

## Work Experience

**Mazars UK** (September 2019 to September 2021)  
Graduate Trainee Accountant

- Gained experience establishing and nurturing client relationships, as well as managing a large portfolio of clients based in the UK and abroad. 
- Worked directly with partners on several projects, gaining valuable insight into the financial services industry. 
- Developed strong verbal and written communication skills, including the ability to explain highly technical concepts to clients in terms they find digestible.

## Skills

#### Ability to pick up new information quickly and independently

- Six months into my role at my previous firm the stay-at-home order was announced with many companies being blindsided as to the impact this would have on their business. 
- I offered to research into the assistance provided by the government and the extent to which different types of businesses would be able to utilise this. 
- After consolidating all the relevant government publications I was able to prepare a standardised briefing for our clients that would provide a sense of ease.
- We were able to provide the briefing to much positive feedback from clients.

#### Excellent verbal and written communication skills

- I was tasked with helping run weekly training on different developments within the Banking industry.
- This required creating powerpoint presentations to present to the Financial Services team alongside more senior members of staff.
- This further developed my communication skills as often we were tasked with explaining complex developments in terms that would be digestible to the audience.
- The weekly trainings were well received as there were junior staff who had less knowledge of the Banking sector, as well as Senior staff who had less knowledge of technology developments.
